00:46:25 E: OK, so thanks a lot and let's be maybe go through the debriefing questions. So, I guess like a first question is if your perception of those, like, main characteristics of your data changed in any way in using the tool or did you have new insights about your data? 

46:57 F: Yeah. So for me, definitely the tone that I use in the commits is very different than the one I use in the journals. The commits is way more to the point, and the journal is slightly more deranged. 

47:19 E: That's interesting, thanks.  

47:20 R: All right, So what does that and what does that mean? 

47:23 F: I think the journal is much richer and the data in like data that it has, but there's also like a lot of like fluff and trash and me trying to grasp a point. And then I think because I usually would write the journal first, trying to grasp a point and then in the commit I'm, like, Oh yeah, right, let's write a real quick summary of what happened here. But in some cases I do feel like, now comparing one to the other, I do feel like I cut some corners in the commits. Some of them are too short. 

48:02  R OK. And are you able to do this comparison because they are now presented within the same UI like they look the same. (F: Yeah.) OK, that's interesting. 

48:17 E: Other notes. 

48:21 C: I guess. I found trying to use this tool almost was blocking my train of thought with regard to my project and a lot of that had to do with just like UI small UI stuff, but it was actually kind of striking that I guess I had this mental pinboard of how commits related to files in my project and at the moment I tried to convey any of that into the software I was like I couldn't. There was an issue with the scroll bar was cut off all off for the commit messages and part of the text was and so trying to track commits down so, I could draw the lines between files and codes and commits that I have in my brain just proved impractical because I'd just scrolled blindly through a wall of text. Being able to like search by keywords in a way that would actually bring up the commit or to have when you pull commits by patterns having that listed generates, have links that will force scroll to that commit would be useful because there were times where I put in a pattern and from the title of the commit, which is just the first line of the paragraph. Essentially it wasn't immediately clear if the list being generated was actually useful for the pattern I was looking for. I guess in an interesting way it almost closed off my ways of thinking about my project because suddenly I was grappling with the way the tool structures things rather than the sort of mental schema I have been operating with. 

50:18 E: That's super useful. Thank you. 

50:21 R: Hey, Chip. Chip, would you be up for like sketching what you would have liked to see instead or what would have facilitated your workflow? (C: Yeah, absolutely) Great.

50:37 L: I went with a repo whose structure I wasn't like super familiar with because I figured that my own would take forever to download. So I found myself zeroing in on commit messages that either didn't have a description at all, and so just the title, or mentioned MDM documentation files like the why, the journal, the to do list in order to either explore the folder structure and see what like what I wanted to include in my export package, or specifically searching for the file that they mentioned in the commit message so I could like compare the changes between commit messages where it's mentioned. And the thing that was hard about that using the tool was that all of the folders were expanded so I have to like click on the little arrow to just like get to the top level of the of the of the repo and find the process folder, so yeah.

51:54 E: Thank you. Maybe we can go to the next question. Well, it's similar one, but it's did using the tool change the data you ended up including from your initial plans?

52:12 F: Yeah, I think so. Because I was thinking like the most interesting part would be the journal but I find that comparing the commit message to the journal entry is actually more interesting. 

52:34 R:

Are you doing like a sort of a comparative in your mind, you're trying to time stamp them and you're like doing that as you look at it?

52:42 F: Yeah, I think so. I think I'm like trying it looks like a black box trying to figure out like what happened here? Like what? Because there's like, one part that is, like almost like like too concrete or just like very short, like updates. OK, this is really what happened. Some very vague thoughts and then I think like with the tagging, I'm trying to combine them like oh here this is a like a decision making moment or this is like a making moment or yeah.

53:16 R: That's interesting what you said. This is what really happened. 

53:20 F: (laughs) Are you ever sure what?

53:22 R: What materially happened? I guess.

53:29 O: Yeah, yeah, at lots of commits I'd take the snapshots of both the work and the documentation separately. That's what I ended up doing, was that all the ones that I exported were for the core feature moments and then for documentation I didn't sort of align them I I made them 2 tracks almost. And of course tag certain certain sort of important moments like latest and this is when I started doing the work, that's when I started doing documentation. And so I sort of track these story moments sometimes for these two for documentation and for files specifically. But I could see ways to get them integrated together, but that's what I did. 

54:15 R: Owen, and where are you wanting to use the same tag across both tracks? 

54:21 O: Interesting idea. Well, I I created 3 codes of things. I did one for when I started the programming work I did one for the one I started the documentation and then I had the latest. I only have like five or six commits in this particular repo. So not much to work with. But that's that's what I immediately started doing (?) for use of any other kind so that's what was my initial reaction to it. Yeah. And I think that theoretically if I was going forward with this I would add documentation specific tags and work for programming specific tag and then maybe one or two very specific like build number one and build number 2.

55:06 L: For me, I don't think I really changed my plan a lot at this point. Like I I saw this as a first like filtering step and like I just wanted to get as much data as possible so like I was going into it with the assumption that I wanted to track MDM related documentation, so I just looked for that and then I figured I would just include every commit message possible and then look at it later. 

55:41 R: Well, here's a here's a related question for all of you who have code who was like, I want to look at my code. 

55:49 P: I mean, it's the very least from the final comment I would, yeah. And then potentially for other commits. I think one of the things that I've been thinking about and I haven't actually done any analysis or anything, but one of the things I wondered about is it's pretty likely that you would do an import and then think oh it would have been good to have, blah blah blah as well. What are the implications of importing again? Do you lose like say you did some analysis work and then like wait a second would be good to pull in this commit's worth of code. Is there a way to jus stick it in? 

56:27 E: Right now it doesn't. Yeah. And I don't think he would be able to the way that... Unless. Maybe I could open QPX project here and then work from there, but yeah, I think like it'll be tricky.

56:40 P: Yes, that what I was wondering.

56:42 E: But one thing we could do is something like a different kind of export, which is a different kind of export which instead of exporting codes and exporting things would just export the sources in a way that can be imported into an existing project (P: right) so like it would convert them into formats that NVivo can read and then you can import them as sources and you do your coding there. 

57:09 P: That's nice because you're still using the UI to kind of select stuff. (E: That'd be one way of doing it) Yeah, that workflow would potentially be super useful I think. OK, I can see myself wanting to do that. 

57:20 E: Yeah. Because then also like it doesn't. It would also work for not being using those tools. If you just wanted to have like a cross section of your thing (P: If if they're pulling it out anyway) and you're pulling it out, and then you're reading it as text in Google Docs, whatever, that could work. Yeah, that's a possibility. Chip had their hand raised. Chip, do you want it to? 

57:47 C: Yeah, I I just encountered.... Like my project has code of a sort that it sort of crossed my mind that it would be interesting to compare versions of it. The problem is it's TouchDesigner, so it's it's node based and I I don't know if there's a way to like I don't know if there's a practical way to convert that over, because making that text is, if it's even doable. I'm sure is impossible to actually read. So I I don't know if there's a way to, I mean like if there was a way to create a high level snapshot of just what the TouchDesigner like workspace, the network of nodes look like I think that would be interesting, but I also don't know if that's doable, because that's like a graphic UI thing that I'm not sure can be automated.

58:51 L: I was going to say that I've been taking, like constant screenshots of my node networks on Unreal, of the blueprints. So I think, I mean it's a, it's like very manual and labor intensive on the side of like documentation but, you know, if you know that you have screenshots, you could probably pull those and compare. 

59:12 C: Well, I I guess I was. I hadn't particularly thought about it until using this tool (R: Right) but going forward, I may be thinking more about screenshotting that that node network because yeah, not, other than manually downloading each version of that file, opening it and taking a screenshot. Now I don't. I don't think that's possible to generate that in an automated fashion.

59:39 E: Yeah, that's a very good point. I feel like that I almost feel like this still should have like a plug in system where it could maybe like I really need to have this specific tool for this application because that would be really, really useful. But yeah, but I guess like maybe this idea of like screenshots could be useful for now, yeah. But that's interesting. That's really useful. Yeah, maybe. I don't know, it's already 12h05. Could we continue some of the questions or? 

1:00:16 R: Hey, well, how about this? Anyone who wants to leave you can, and we're very appreciative if you are willing to stay until we get to the end of the questions. (P: Where are at the questions?)

1:00:36 E: We are two out of six, but I think we can cut off two at the end.(F: Same, hungry, hungry, though getting more hungry.) Well, Ok this one is a bit shorter and I think it's related to the to the previous one, did you find new gaps in your data?

1:01:05 P: You mean temporal gaps?

1:01:13 E: Maybe. Or or kinds of data or things you didn't record that you wanted to report, or...

1:01:14 O: Yeah, maybe I've got some my data, but gaps in meaningfulness, I suppose, because I do a lot of like I sit down and I have a lot of that and then a little bit of this, a little bit of that, a little bit that that, I will I will push a bunch of little tiny nameless ones, or a few big ones? And I'm erratic like that so. And so when I'm doing this and I'm just tagging like this is when I started. This is when I finished this feature here, there's a lot of useless comments in between that I don't and I don't won't go through the end and that was, yeah, that's there. It's not that datais being lost is not really important data and maybe I don't know. That's just what I thought when we said gaps.

1:02:04 R: Oh, and that's interesting. I mean, it almost makes me think that there's maybe not in this tool, but some possibility to remind designers and makers to like periodically put in something meaningful. Otherwise you sit down to do analysis, you're going to be shocked at the gap.

1:02:28 O: You can, you could assign a point system.

1:02:32 R: Yeah, just like kind of regular, yeah. 

1:02:36 E: But I feel like that points also to the thing of like having particular routines (R: Exactly) or having kind of like prompt that could help with that in many ways like kind of like having. (R: The persona)

1:02:48 O: Like we were thinking of doing, like having like suggested commit styles or suggested MDM style we have suggested ways to do this repo to QDA based on the type of MDM you're doing. 

1:03:03 R: That's true.

1:03:07 E: Yeah, cool. Anyone else?

1:03:11 L: Yeah. I feel the gaps were kind of like related to that as well just felt the need to explore the folder structure and look for things to include whenever the commit messages look kind of sparse. 

1:03:25 R: OK, this is this is interesting. I want to drill down on that. Did did you like look at it and you're like ohh, there's less here than I thought or...

1:03:34 L: Well, no, I I saw that there were very chunky commit messages, but then there were some that just had titles. So I'm like what's going on there and the title is suggestive itself. So I know what to look for. So it's not really a gap, it's just kind of like a like like a clue for me to pay closer attention.

1:04:01 R: So Enric we've been thinking about this tool as something that people apply it to mostly finished repo but in fact, if you loaded it up soon after you started it, it would actually remind you to to to be more thoughtful about how you write commit messages as well. 

1:04:19 E: Yeah, that's an interesting. It's it's a different lens into what (R: Yeah, yeah). 

1:04:25 V: I was actually wondering in that sense like will it then make sense to have this file that it generates also to put that in the repo? It would be kind of (R: Yeah, and why not? ) It's like something would explode but...

1:04:44 R: No, there's no base case ever...

1:04:47 E: No, but I think like the, yeah, but there is a level of like OK using this tool on an ongoing project. How does that fit back into it? And how you do trace that? That is a that's a good thing to try out like Whoa, what pieces of data was I thinking that were important and now like how that changed, yeah. 

1:05:05 R: I mean, that's so true this is a tool that's part of the dev process just as any other tool is influencing your dev process. Well, this one, I think we can. I suggest that we table it because I think we already got plenty of these would would would were like what were the points of friction in using the tool. I think we got a whole lot of them maybe more than I can actionably work on in the short term. (R: That's totally fine, yeah) So that's completely fine. I guess like the more important one is, did you have any ideas of insight about your data or analysis process while using the tool? Like about your process of analysis?

1:06:00 R: I think maybe focusing on the farmer is going to be better for our crowd right now.

1:06:03 E: So yeah, about your data, yeah.

1:06:07 R: And maybe we've already covered this question in the sense well.

1:06:13 E: OK. So the last one is how do you rate the process of including the sources, but I guess like can be just any final impressions. Thoughts.

1:06:17 P: Pretty bloody impressive. (R: Yeah, yeah.) (E: Cool. Awesome.)

1:06:30 R: And like I have to say that interface looking at it looked pretty intuitive as well, right? Yeah. I mean, obviously there's tweets that can be made, but it's pretty understandable.

1:06:41 L: Night mode.

1:06:41 E: Yeah, I'll think of including dark mode just. You make the Konami code, and that's great. I think, like, thank you very much. Like, I feel like it's useful. We have lots of very good feedback, thanks.
