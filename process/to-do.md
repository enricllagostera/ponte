## Backlog

- [ ] Allow importing from wiki as individual files or as folder compilations
- [ ] Load commits from wiki repo and display in commit feed
- [ ] Improve keyboard accessibility of the tree navigation in file selection
- [ ] Visualize commits in an ordered topological timeline (usual git charts)
- [ ] Encode manually selected files
- [ ] Ignore commits from subject (simple string pattern)
- [ ] Compile folders from glob pattern
- [ ] Copy file as sources and encode from filename (glob pattern)
- [ ] Encode files from text content (glob pattern, aka auto-code)
- [ ] Encode files from filename (glob patterns)
- [ ] Encode commits from full text content (glob pattern)
- [ ] Create a URI handler (see Electron Deep Link feature) that will open a specific version of the app that can run web-based playable builds from the local commits. Alternatively, show a list of build folders per commit.


## High priority

- [ ] Visualize a timeline of commits showing passage of time between them
- [ ] Separate commands **compile folder** from **individual and hierarchical file selection** in file preview, showing them as diff GUI elements
- [ ] Convert tag input to Melt UI
- [ ] Embed images as base64 in devlogs or link to them on GitHub
- [ ] Change relative links to GitHub links in devlogs
