## Wishlist

- [ ] Allow importing from wiki as individual files or as folder compilations
- [ ] Load commits from wiki repo and display in commit feed
- [ ] Improve keyboard accessibility of the tree navigation in file selection
- [ ] Create a URI handler (see Electron Deep Link feature) that will open a specific version of the app that can run web-based playable builds from the local commits. Alternatively, show a list of build folders per commit.


## Backlog

- [ ] Encode manually selected files
- [ ] Change relative links to GitHub links in devlogs
- [ ] Ignore commits from subject (simple string pattern)
- [ ] Compile folders from glob pattern
- [ ] Copy file as sources and encode from filename (glob pattern)
- [ ] Encode files from text content (glob pattern, aka auto-code)
- [ ] Encode files from filename (glob patterns)
- [ ] Encode commits from full text content (glob pattern)
- [ ] Embed images as base64 in devlogs or link to them on GitHub


## High priority

- [ ] Re-organize the export preview and actions panel
- [ ] Implement full-text filter for commit messages plus devlog in blogroll view


## In progress



## Done

**Complete**
