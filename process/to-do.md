## Backlog

- [ ] Allow importing from wiki as individual files or as folder compilations
- [ ] Load commits from wiki repo and display in commit feed
- [ ] Encode manually selected files
- [ ] Ignore commits from subject (simple string pattern)
- [ ] Compile devlogs with advanced options (git footer)
- [ ] Compile folders from glob pattern
- [ ] Copy file as sources and encode from filename (glob pattern)
- [ ] Encode files from text content (glob pattern, aka auto-code)
- [ ] Encode files from filename (glob patterns)
- [ ] Encode commits from full text content (glob pattern)
- [ ] Create a URI handler (see Electron Deep Link feature) that will open a specific version of the app that can run web-based playable builds from the local commits. Alternatively, show a list of build folders per commit.


## High priority

- [ ] Load components only when in view to optimize performance
- [ ] Fix exported files
- [ ] Visualize a timeline of commits showing passage of time between them
- [ ] Visualize commits in an ordered topological timeline (usual git charts)


## In progress

- [ ] Research options to optimize disk space use and download times


## Done

**Complete**
