# Ideas for a research paper on repo-to-qda

## 2023-09-15 Revised research design

The main difference would be to do the case studies based on workshops with the other participants, record / note them using the tool and analysing that.

1. Present the tool
   1. Related work
      1. Games as research: @khaled2018a and @khaled2023
      2. @evers2018 on qualitative tool users ad developers
      3. @wolski2018 on history of QDAs
      4. @melgarestrada2018 on audiovisual media annotation in QDAs
   2. What it does and how, main features and processes
   3. Why
      1. Facilitate the use of methodologies such as GT and thematic analysis on research-creation processes;
      2. Facilitate analysis of repos created using the MDM methodology;
      3. Piggyback on quali-tool expertise and use in humanities and arts-focused researchers;
         1. Think of existing quali tools as an installed base and an ecosystem to be added to.
      4. Close the gap between game dev roles and quali-research;
   4. Design directions / decisions
      1. Values of openness: use of standard, FOSS formats in REFI-QDA;
      2. Values f portability: a base project that can be opened and used in different tools (proprietary or not);
   5. Challenges
      1. How to quali-code and memo playable builds?
      2. How to include visualizations?
         1. Maybe export hi-res images and diagrams that can be annotated within QDAs (using picture selection);
2. Cases
   1. Use the tool in "it's as if you're making love", by Pippin.
      1. Tool setup and experience of use
   2. Use the tool on its own development repo.
   3. Workshop with other GaR members using it to start analysis on a shared analysis case.
3. Findings of cases about tool use
   1. TBD
4. Shared data
   1. Publish the files themselves
      1. Config files for cases 1 and 2.
      2. Output from tool: blank project for cases 1 and 2;
      3. Full REFI-QDA file and sources from cases 1 and 2;
5. Findings and contributions
   1. TBD;
6. Future research
   1. Opportunity: Complementing the materials by combining them with recordings of let's play videos or dev streaming;
   2. Opportunity: Use for software studies, as it allows for quali-coding source code;
   3. Use for comparing analysis and quali-coding processes (by devs vs external team);
   4. Use in GaR research projects using MDM (or not using it)

## 2023-08-02 Initial idea: case study focused paper

This is a paper idea (for DIS?), which I discussed (in a high-level format) with Rilla on 2023-08-02. After the meeting, I fleshed out some possible outlines.
