## QA - Qualitative Analysis

This activity can take a variety of methodologies, such as thematic analysis, grounded theory, and others.

## QDAS or CAQDAS - Computer Aided Qualitative Data Analysis Software

Tools like NVivo, Atlas.ti, MAXQDA, QualCoder. Most of these are proprietary and closed tools. These tools are mostly used for [QA](#QA,%20for%20Qualitative%20Analysis), but can also be used for literature reviews and other forms of reference-heavy textual analysis.

## QDPX

The main file format of the [[#REFI-QDA]] standard exchange format. Consists of a ZIP file containing a `project.qde` file (which is an XML file) and a `Sources` folder with the project's source files in a flat structure.

## REFI-QDA

A standard exchange format between [QDAS or CAQDAS - Computer Aided Qualitative Data Analysis Software](#QDAS%20or%20CAQDAS%20-%20Computer%20Aided%20Qualitative%20Data%20Analysis%20Software) tools. It was created by a consortium of the main companies that create these software tools. It is an open source format, but with little open tooling around it (no open and public repos, no NPM packages, sample implementations in any language, etc).
