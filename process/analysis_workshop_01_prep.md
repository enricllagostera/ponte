# Analysis workshop prep (2023-10-05)

I tweaked some of these based on the questionnaire about QDAS learning strategies and usability notes from @freitas2019 and general methodological questions raised in @gilbert2014 .

- Context: informal, preliminary impressions, early use of prototype.
- Data collection: audio recording; Zoom recording;

## Briefing questions

1. Preparing data from repo
	1. What data points or sources do you plan to include?
	2. What sources do you expect to relate to a single version or multiple version?
	3. What do you expect the balance in your data to be (between design artifacts and process docs)?
	4. What main characteristics do you associate with the data you have in the repo?

## Things to observe during use

1. Observe which features users are engaging with more / less
2. Note which errors are happening
3. Validate the main actions and areas of the interface
4. Note surprises that might emerge

## Debriefing questions

1. Preparing data from repo
	1. Did your perception of the main characteristics you associate with the repo data change in any way?
	2. Did using the tool <change / suggest / block> the data you ended up including?
	3. Did you find new gaps you in your data?
	4. What were the main points of friction in using the tool?
	5. Did you have any ideas or insight about your data or analysis process while using the tool?
	6. How do you rate the process of including the sources you expected?
