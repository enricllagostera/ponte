# 12 On GUI refactoring

I want the app to look and feel a bit easier to use. Making it in a way that facilitates later development is also tricky.

For now, I decided to focus on dividing it up into panels, with a roughly left-to-right flow. Also trying to keep a coherent symbology, like dark grey for inactive actions / unselected options or footers for status messaging.

Svelte was really helpful for this. I feel like creating components and keeping them coherent has been a direct process now that I'm more used to it. I am still very unfamiliar with it, so there is lots of searching for help and references.
