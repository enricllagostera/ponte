# 06 Some reverse engineering

After all the issues with the format differences between the tools import/export, I took Atlas.ti as a base and started using it to validate / test my exports. That worked pretty well, and I added some basic sample QDPX files generated by Atlas.ti as a reference. 

This made me think that one of the key elements in this kind of reverse engineering / fitting into an ecosystem is to be able to test things in a convenient and less costly way. I can definitely see how CAQDAS software being so expensive helps to shut down work in the tool ecosystem around them.

Some trial and error is always needed.
