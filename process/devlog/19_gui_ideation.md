# 19 New ideas for GUI

(ts::2023-10-26T17:55:40-04:00)

I had a short conversation with Joseph yesterday and after that I thought it might be good to write down some if the ideas I've been having for new GUI elements to add to the app.

First, there would be a panel where you can see detailed information about the thing you have selected last, be that a commit or a file. For both of them it would be interesting to have something that shows information about them at that specific point in time and, for files, a more generalized context throughout the project.

For commits, one idea that I had was to have almost like a word cloud at the bottom of the commit card that shows file names with their relative size mapped to the amount of changes that they had, in terms of lines of code. They can be color / icon coded or have some kind of proportional background color based on addition / deletion, file size, and so on. The idea is that this kind of visual presentation would give a very quick glimpse of which files might be relevant and that have specifically changed in that commit.

I have been thinking a lot about the main navigation area being something like different tabs or leaves that you can browse between and that has like a very long scrolling area with different visualizations. The main one would be a similar one to the current timeline but may be displayed in a horizontal way. Another one would be a timeline that shows both branching and changes over time. Another one would be the list of most changed files across the whole project in a table format.

In terms of the preview panel that shows what's going to be exported I think it would be interesting to have a detailed list that is more condensed than what is currently there. Maybe some better way of grouping files.
