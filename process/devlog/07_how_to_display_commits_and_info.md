# 07 How to display commits and info

Had to think a lot about what formats these tools can display. Docx and PDFs are two alternatives that can keep both images and text together. I went with docx for now, but it might be better to actually work with PDF? I am not sure. It is pretty clear that richer text formats are def necessary, if supported by the CAQDAS tools.

The more files in the document list without some kind of grouping, the more polluted some of the GUI becomes. Commits and files are numerous, and these tools were made for less and larger files. As I also have to use the filenames for ordering purposes, this gets convoluted.

So an important question that emerges from these is: **how to help the researcher to cut through noise?**

Some ideas that I'm experimenting with:

1. Provide useful compilations (devlogs, process journals)
2. Visualizations (Git timeline)
3. Indexes that point to useful information outside of the CAQDAS environment (links to builds, links to repo at point in time, links to "blame" pages for specific files)
4. Provide coding that helps bring together meaningful information
