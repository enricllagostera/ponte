# 20 A chronological timeline for commits

The info I'd like to highlight in this view is:

- [x] Passage of time
- [x] Zoomable timeline
- [x] Commits as small cards
  - Pill with hashAbbrev
  - Subject
- [x] Summary of file changes
- Branching structure
- Selectable commits that show details on a separate frame

This timeline could then be readapted to files themselves, from Chip's idea.
