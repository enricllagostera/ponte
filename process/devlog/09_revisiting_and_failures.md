title: "Revisiting the app's technical infrastructure (and failing)"
---

Now that I'm moving to working on the GUI functionality, I want to make sure that the app stack will be maintainable and usable.

Right now, everything is implemented in one place, just for testing out. As I refactor to better organzie things, I'm thinking of working two changes with an eye to a longer term dev workflow: creating a basic plugin system for functionality and changing the codebase to Typescript.

(...) After spending a lot of time (around 6 hours total) trying to do this change, I failed completely. The tooling and issues involved where impossible for me to overcome within the time frame. I feel bad that I couldn't fix this, but it will need a programmer more experienced in that tool stack. I'll move back to working on getting the UI usable and a basic customization flow going for the QDPX generation.
