# 22 Coding themes

The way I approach things.

## Codes (direct markings)

- Inductive and trying to use words from materials (grounded theory-style)
- Descriptive and reifying an observation on activity (e.g. changes to journal.md are _journaling_, but I could try to mark as _reflective journal_ vs _log_ when too descriptive)
  - Some of these could be defined _a priori_ based in our design epistemology
  - @schon2017 -Problem framing
  - @khaled2023 - Generative logic, Conceptual click, bidirectional framing
  - Using codes from literature would give us a library of previous examples to draw from in our writing for comparison / discussion /triangulation.
  - [ ] Prototyping for designers book

## Categories (groups of markings)

- Emerge from grouping codes and are mostly organizational
- There might be some _a priori_ groupings for cross-project comparisons - @lim2008 - Prototype filtering and materialization

## Themes (writing)

- Emerge from interrelating groups and codes into observable themes that make explicit my interpretation of them.
- Cannot be defined a priori.
