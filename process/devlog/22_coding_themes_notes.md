# 22 Coding themes

The way I approach things.

## Codes (direct markings)

- Inductive and trying to use words from materials (grounded theory-style)
- Descriptive and reifying an observation on activity (e.g. changes to journal.md are *journaling*, but I could try to mark as *reflective journal* vs *log* when too descriptive)
	- Some of these could be defined *a priori* based in our design epistemology
	- @schon2017 -Problem framing
	- @khaled2023 - Generative logic, Conceptual click, bidirectional framing
	- Using codes from literature would give us a library of previous examples to draw from in our writing for comparison / discussion /triangulation.
	- [ ] Prototyping for designers book

## Categories (groups of markings)

- Emerge from grouping codes and are mostly organizational
- There might be some *a priori* groupings for cross-project comparisons
		- @lim2008 - Prototype filtering and materialization

## Themes (writing)

- Emerge from interrelating groups and codes into observable themes that make explicit my interpretation of them.
- Cannot be defined a priori.
