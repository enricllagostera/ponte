Talked to Joseph some more before the GaR meeting. He asked some great questions and also made some proposal on how to approach the UX and tool definition (back-to-front, front-to-back, tool goals).

A question he asked that was very useful was: what is the difference of **archivistagd** and **repo-to-qda**? Here is how I articulated that and we talked about:

- **archivista** is a series of lenses to look at a repo: blogroll, filtering by tags and words, playing the game at different points in time
- **repo-to-qda** is a tool for preparing a corpus for analysis: filtering the data collected (the repo), reformatting some data (creating compilations, merging files, some conversions), some starting annotations (in the form of preliminary coding), generate some visualizations as corpus material (timeline image, videos?).
	- What are the opinions that the tool puts forward? How does it want to support game design research, the particular step of *corpus preparation*. 

An action point for the group: familiarize people with qualitative analysis tools and methodologies ([CAQDAS, or Computer Aided Qualitative Data Analysis Software](glossary.md#CAQDAS,%20or%20Computer%20Aided%20Qualitative%20Data%20Analysis%20Software) and [QDA, or Qualitative Data Analysis](glossary.md#QDA,%20or%20Qualitative%20Data%20Analysis)).
