# Repo to QDA

A tool to prepare game dev project repositories for analysis using QDA (qualitative data analysis) digital tools. This is a continuation and new direction on the [archivista gd](https://www.npmjs.com/package/archivistagd) tool. Its main purpose is to facilitate qualitative methodologies being applied to game creation processes documented using the MDM approach (Khaled et al. 2018). It does so by taking a project repository URL from GitHub and processing it to create a structured project file in the REFI-QDA format, ready to be imported into QDA tools (e.g. QualCoder, Atlas.ti, NVivo) for analysis. This QDA-compatible file includes metadata about each version/commit of the project as well as visualizations and other relevant information, facilitating qualitative coding and annotation across project versions and stages in development.

This project is being developed by [Enric Granzotto Llagostera](https://enric.llagostera.com.br) as part of the [Games as Research](https://www.gamesasresearch.com/) project.
